# Unemployment-Rate-in-the-US
In this project, I created a set of visualizations using D3.js and Observablehq to explore data related to unemployment rates across different US states and on varied factors. I made use of choropleth maps to present this data in an interactive and engaging way.
<br>
<br>
First, I loaded the data into Observablehq using the d3.csv() function. I then used this data to create a choropleth map that color-coded US states based on their unemployment rates over varied factors such as the Unemployment rate in the satates, unemployment rate based on the occupation, and what would unemployment risk according to the occupation. I also added a legend to this map to help users interpret the colors and understand the range of unemployment rates represented.

<br>
Overall, this project demonstrates how D3.js and Observablehq can be used to create interactive and engaging data visualizations that help users explore complex data sets in a meaningful way.
